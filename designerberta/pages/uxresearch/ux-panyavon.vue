      <h1>Case Study: UX Research for a Cambodian Language Learning App</h1>
  
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
          This UX research aimed to create a user-centered, culturally responsive language learning app tailored to the needs of Cambodian users learning English and Cambodians learning Khmer. Given the target audience—primarily illiterate Cambodians who lack the financial means or digital skills to purchase and install paid applications—it was imperative that the app be entirely free to use and download. This decision ensured accessibility to users regardless of their financial situation, digital literacy, or access to paid services.

    <h3>User Identification</h3>
      <p>
          The target users for this app were primarily illiterate Cambodians who:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Have limited financial resources and cannot afford paid apps.</li>
          <li>Lack the digital literacy needed to navigate complex app interfaces or use desktop/laptop computers.</li>
          <li>Rely primarily on mobile phones for accessing digital content.</li>
          <li>Struggle with language learning due to low literacy in Khmer and challenges in acquiring typing and computer skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          By identifying these factors, I could ensure the app would be designed with their unique needs in mind, particularly considering issues such as mobile-first accessibility, low literacy support, and an intuitive user experience.

    <h3>Selecting Research Methods</h3>
      <p>
          To understand the users’ needs comprehensively, I chose a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods:
      </p>
      <ol>
          <li><strong>Immersive User Research</strong>: This method involved moving to Cambodia, enrolling in a Khmer language class, and experiencing language acquisition as a beginner.</li>
          <li><strong>Ethnographic Fieldwork</strong>: Informal interviews and field studies were conducted to understand local language learning challenges and the role of technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Usability Testing</strong>: Testing prototypes and interfaces with local users helped identify usability issues, especially regarding mobile usage and literacy.</li>
          <li><strong>Journey Mapping</strong>: To track user experiences, a journey map was created to illustrate how users might interact with the app over time and what pain points they might face.</li>
      </ol>
  
      <h3>Conducting Research: Interviews, Usability Testing, and Field Studies</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Interviews and Observations</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>I conducted informal interviews with Cambodians who were learning English, asking about their language learning experiences, technology access, and challenges.</li>
          <li>Common insights included issues like literacy barriers, limited time for structured learning, and a lack of access to desktop devices.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
          <strong>Usability Testing</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Initial wireframes and prototypes of the app were tested with a small group of users, observing how they interacted with the interface. This revealed the need for simple navigation and visual aids, especially for users with low literacy.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
          <strong>Field Studies</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>I spent time tutoring two local Cambodians in English, observing their struggles and misunderstandings around pronunciation and grammar. This interaction provided insights into how language learning resources are structured in Cambodia and what methods resonate best with local learners.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
          <strong>Cultural Integration</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Participating in Cambodian holidays like Bon Om Touk and Pchum Ben gave me insight into the cultural context of language use, revealing important idioms, expressions, and vocabulary that could be incorporated into the app to enhance its cultural relevance.</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Data Analysis and Key Insights</h3>
      <p>
          From the research activities, I gathered a wealth of insights:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobile-First Design</strong>: Since most Cambodians rely on mobile phones, a mobile-first approach was crucial.</li>
          <li><strong>Low Literacy Support</strong>: With many learners having limited literacy, the app needed intuitive design, visual aids, and audio instructions to help guide them through lessons.</li>
          <li><strong>Technology and Access Barriers</strong>: Given the target audience’s lack of access to computers, the app had to be mobile-compatible, lightweight, and easy to install and use without complex registration or setup.</li>
          <li><strong>Cultural Relevance</strong>: Including Cambodian holidays, local idioms, and cultural references in the curriculum made the learning experience more engaging and relatable.</li>
          <li><strong>TESOL Principles</strong>: Aligning with TESOL standards allowed for structured, progressive learning pathways that could cater to various learning levels.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="prototype">
    <h3>Journey Mapping and Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
          Using the insights gathered, I created journey maps to visualize how users would progress through the app. The maps highlighted:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Initial onboarding challenges (such as registration and navigation for illiterate users).</li>
          <li>Pain points around engaging with content (especially for non-typers).</li>
          <li>Long-term engagement strategies to keep users motivated through culturally relevant lessons and gamification.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          These journey maps were key in informing the user flow and interactions in the app prototype.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Integrating Findings into the Figma Design</h3>
      <p>
          Once I had a clear understanding of the user needs and pain points, I integrated the findings into a Figma file to visualize the app's interface and user flow. This included:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>A mobile-optimized layout.</li>
          <li>Simplified navigation with large buttons and minimal text.</li>
          <li>Audio instructions for each lesson to support illiterate users.</li>
          <li>Use of visual aids, pictures, and culturally familiar references in the lessons.</li>
      </ul>

  <section class="gatheringinsight">
    <h3>Receiving Feedback and Iterating</h3>
      <p>
          To refine the app design, I gathered feedback from local Cambodians who tested the prototype. Their input helped me identify areas where further simplification was needed, particularly with language instructions and navigation elements. Based on this feedback, I iterated on the design by:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Making navigation even more intuitive.</li>
          <li>Adding more visual cues to support understanding.</li>
          <li>Ensuring that lessons could be completed without text-based input, which was a barrier for non-typers.</li>
      </ul>
  
  
  </section>
  <section class="ethics">
    <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
      <p>
          Throughout the research process, I maintained a focus on ethical considerations, ensuring that:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Participants were informed about the research goals and methods.</li>
          <li>Their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw at any time.</li>
          <li>Data was handled with confidentiality, and no personal information was collected without explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          This ethical approach helped build trust with the participants and ensured that the research was conducted with integrity.
      </p>

    <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <p>
          I meticulously documented all stages of the research process, from interviews and field studies to usability testing and iteration. This documentation not only provided a clear record of the research process but also allowed for continual reflection and refinement of the app design based on real-world insights.
      </p>
  
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
          This case study highlights the critical importance of immersive, hands-on UX research in designing a culturally relevant, user-centric language learning app. By embedding myself in the Cambodian context—living there, learning the language, interviewing locals, observing cultural events, and aligning with TESOL standards—I gathered invaluable insights that directly influenced the app’s design. The result is a free, mobile-first, easy-to-use language learning app that meets the unique needs of Cambodia’s illiterate population, ensuring that learning English or Khmer is accessible, engaging, and culturally relevant.
