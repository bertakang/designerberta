            This project showcases a portfolio piece for the nearly complete
            Khmer/English language learning app. All digital paintings,
            animations, typography, and user experience designs were created by
            me, Berta Kang. The app is being developed using Flutter, Isar for
            local storage, and LottieFiles for lightweight animations, combining
            these technologies to deliver an engaging and efficient learning
            experience.

          <h2>Project Brief</h2>
          <p>
            The objective of this app is to provide a user-friendly language
            learning platform for English-speaking Cambodian (Khmer) and
            Cambodian-speaking English language learners. The app provides a
            simple and efficient way for users to learn and practice both
            languages, featuring interactive lessons, quizzes, and
            vocabulary-building tools. Thoroughly researched during my time
            living in Cambodia, it is specifically designed to address the
            challenges of offering language literacy to a targeted Cambodian
            audience with limited formal education. As a result, the app will be
            free to use, fully functional offline, and include a wealth of audio
            content to enhance the learning experience for users of all levels.

          <p>
            Users practice their listening and speaking skills by matching
            flashcards with correct pronunciation. The game uses interactive
            voice recognition with speech-to-text technology and provides clear

            traditional Cambodian kickboxing, where precision and rhythm are
            key, paralleling the learning of language nuances.
